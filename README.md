- 1 serving of wet food mixed with water
    - 1 serving of wet food : 0.5~0.75 serving of water
- Dry food mixed with freeze dried treats
    - ground the treats to small pieces and mix it with the dry food
- Add hairball treatment tablet to his dry food is preferred. I do this almost every day but it's okay if you forget sometimes. Make sure he has it at least 3 times a week.
    - 2 tablets per day
    - slipt it into small pieces, 4 or 5-ish
- Water in the water fountain
    - Make sure the water is above minimum level

## Additional care
- Wipe Mango's eyes every day with kitten eye wipes.
